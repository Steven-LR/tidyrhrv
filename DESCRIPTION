Description: Essentially, tidyrhrv allows a non-experienced programer 
    to quickly load multiple patients electrocardiographic (ECG) data at 
    once and conduct relevant timeanlysis of heart rate variability (HRV) without manuel edits from a 
    physician or one cleaning the ECG data.  
    Unique to this package is it's ability to interatively filter, plot, 
    and store timeanalysis in a data frame while writing plots in a predefined folder.
