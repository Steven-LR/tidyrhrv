The goal of tidyrhrv is to read, iteratively filter, and analyze the time component of multiple HRV data sets at once. 

## Installation

You can install the released version of tidyrhrv from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("tidyrhrv")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example, eval=F}
library(tidyrhrv)

## creating folder for saving raw and filtered images of niHR 
dir.create("./folder_name")

## read in the data using any appropriate function
data <- read_tilt("path", readr::read_csv) %>% 
        
# preps data to be used by subsequent functions
# tell it what is your time var, Heart Beat, and RR series vectors
        prep_data("R-R x", "HR y", "R-R y")

# plot raw data, which will be placed into folder created above
# a tibble of the outputs will be created (ie: rmssd, pnn50)
original_timeanalysis <- data %>% 
                  plot_tilt("folder_name","original")

# filter the data, plot, and retrieve the filtered rmssd, and pnn50 all in one pipe
# set up bounds for iterative filtering if the heart beats are "greater than"  or
# "less than" a certain amount with respect to the smoothing spline of heart beat
filtered_timeanalysis <- data %>% 
                      filter_tilt(1.10, 90) %>% 

# Lastly plot the data and  compare changes in the newly written table
# A new folder is created hosting the raw and filtered plots of each file
                      plot_tilt("folder_name","filtered")


# Join the two tables using rbind()

d_table <- rbind(original_timeanalysis, filtered_timeanalysis)
```
